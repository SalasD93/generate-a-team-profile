## Description

For challenge 10 of the UM Coding Bootcamp, I had to use NodeJS to create a generator that produces an engineering team profile based off user input. The HTML and CSS is dynamically generator based off the team members the user selects. Tests had to be written for each part of code to make sure it functions as expected.
